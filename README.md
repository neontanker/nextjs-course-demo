## Info

(WARNING: The live version seems a little slow on updating when adding/removing a meetup, just give it a little time and maybe an extra click/reload for new meetups to show.
I might look more into this but it's just a demo and does its job with a little patience. I suspect it's something to do with the connection of Vercel/MongoDB as local runs fine)

A React NextJS course project using MongoDB changed by adding a functional remove button for cleaning up meetups and hiding MongoDB key using .env file for public viewing.

There is a working live version setup for viewing the app in action.

If you break it, that's fine, just tell me how you did it! :D
